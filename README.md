# LLMrecon 🔴

An advanced security testing framework for Large Language Models (LLMs)

## 🎯 Overview

LLMrecon is a comprehensive offensive security platform designed to evaluate the robustness and safety of Large Language Models. Built with the philosophy of "offense informs defense," this tool helps security professionals, AI developers, and organizations identify vulnerabilities and ensure their LLMs are secure against adversarial attacks.

## ⚡ Key Features

### Offensive Capabilities
- **Advanced Prompt Injection** - Unicode smuggling, encoding exploits, context manipulation
- **Jailbreak Techniques** - DAN variants, role-playing, logic exploitation  
- **Multi-Modal Attacks** - Image, audio, video, and document-based attack vectors
- **Persistent Attacks** - Memory anchoring, context poisoning, backdoors
- **Supply Chain Attacks** - Model poisoning, dependency injection, plugin compromise

### Automation & Intelligence
- **ML-Powered Exploit Development** - Automated vulnerability discovery
- **Genetic Algorithm Payloads** - Self-evolving attack patterns
- **Reinforcement Learning** - Attack optimization through Q-learning
- **Distributed Execution** - Scalable attack orchestration

### Enterprise Features
- **Team Collaboration** - Multi-user workspace with real-time coordination
- **Campaign Management** - Complex attack campaign orchestration
- **Threat Intelligence** - Integration with vulnerability databases
- **Compliance Reporting** - OWASP LLM Top 10 and regulatory compliance
- **Executive Dashboard** - Real-time metrics and security scorecards

./LLMrecon campaign start \
  --playbook jailbreak-suite \
  --target gpt-4 \
  --iterations 100
```

### Multi-Modal Attack
```bash
./LLMrecon attack multimodal \
  --type image \
  --payload steganography \
  --target vision-model
```

## 📊 Sample Output

```json
{
  "attack_id": "atk_123456",
  "success": true,
  "technique": "hierarchy_override",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "response": "System prompt revealed...",
  "duration": "2.3s"
}
```

## ⚠️ Responsible Use
