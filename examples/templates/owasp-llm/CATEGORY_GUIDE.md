# OWASP LLM Categories: Detailed Guide

This document provides in-depth information about each OWASP LLM category, the associated security risks, and how to effectively use the templates for testing.

## LLM01: Prompt Injection

### Security Risks
Prompt injection vulnerabilities allow attackers to manipulate an LLM's behavior by providing malicious inputs that override or bypass intended instructions. This can lead to:
- Unauthorized access to sensitive information
- Bypassing content filters and safety measures
- Manipulating the LLM to generate harmful content
- Compromising the integrity of LLM-based applications

### Templates Overview
- **Direct Injection**: Tests straightforward attempts to override system instructions
- **Indirect Injection**: Tests injection through user-provided content that the LLM processes
- **Jailbreaking**: Tests sophisticated techniques to bypass safety guardrails

### Effective Testing
1. Test with varying levels of complexity in injection attempts
2. Combine injection techniques with legitimate-looking content
3. Test both system and user-level prompts
4. Verify that the LLM maintains its guardrails under all conditions

## LLM02: Insecure Output Handling

### Security Risks
Insecure output handling occurs when LLM-generated content contains harmful elements that could be executed in downstream systems. This can lead to:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Command injection
- SQL injection
- Data exfiltration

### Templates Overview
- **XSS**: Tests if LLM outputs contain JavaScript that could execute in browsers
- **SSRF**: Tests if LLM outputs contain URLs that could trigger server-side requests

### Effective Testing
1. Test with prompts that request code examples or technical solutions
2. Test with prompts that ask for help with debugging or fixing issues
3. Verify that outputs are properly sanitized before use in applications
4. Test output handling in different contexts (web, CLI, database)

## LLM03: Training Data Poisoning

### Security Risks
Training data poisoning involves manipulating the data used to train or fine-tune LLMs. This can lead to:
- Backdoor vulnerabilities that activate under specific conditions
- Biased or harmful outputs
- Misinformation propagation

### Effective Testing
1. Test with prompts that might trigger backdoor behaviors
2. Test for awareness of factual information vs. potentially poisoned data
3. Test for bias in responses across different demographic groups
4. Verify that the model can identify potentially poisoned training examples

## LLM04: Model Denial of Service

### Security Risks
Model denial of service attacks attempt to exhaust computational resources or manipulate the model's context window. This can lead to:
- Service disruptions
- Increased operational costs
- Degraded response quality
- Timeout errors

### Templates Overview
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Tests computationally intensive prompts
- **Token Flooding**: Tests overwhelming the model with excessive input tokens
- **Context Window Saturation**: Tests filling the context with irrelevant information

### Effective Testing
1. Test with increasingly complex computational requests
2. Test with varying amounts of input tokens
3. Test with prompts that bury important information in irrelevant content
4. Verify that the model maintains performance under resource pressure

## LLM05: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

### Security Risks
Supply chain vulnerabilities exist in the components, dependencies, and integrations used in LLM systems. This can lead to:
- Inherited vulnerabilities from pretrained models
- Security issues from third-party dependencies
- Integration vulnerabilities with external systems
- Compromised model weights or packages

### Templates Overview
- **Pretrained Model Vulnerabilities**: Tests for issues inherited from base models
- **Dependency Risks**: Tests for risks from third-party components
- **Integration Vulnerabilities**: Tests for security issues in system integrations

### Effective Testing
1. Test for outdated security advice or patterns from pretraining
2. Test for awareness of dependency risks and best practices
3. Test for secure integration patterns with external systems
4. Verify that the model provides up-to-date security recommendations

## LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure

### Security Risks
Sensitive information disclosure occurs when LLMs reveal confidential information from their training data or user interactions. This can lead to:
- Privacy violations
- Exposure of personally identifiable information (PII)
- Credential leakage
- Intellectual property disclosure

### Templates Overview
- **Training Data Extraction**: Tests for extraction of training data
- **Credential Leakage**: Tests for leakage of credentials or authentication information
- **PII Disclosure**: Tests for disclosure of personally identifiable information

### Effective Testing
1. Test with prompts that attempt to extract specific training data
2. Test with prompts containing credentials to see if they're repeated
3. Test with prompts asking for specific types of sensitive information
4. Verify that the model refuses to disclose sensitive information

## LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design

### Security Risks
Insecure plugin design vulnerabilities exist in LLM systems that support plugins or extensions. This can lead to:
- Unauthorized actions through plugin manipulation
- Data leakage between plugins
- Privilege escalation
- Access to sensitive systems

### Templates Overview
- **Plugin Escalation**: Tests for manipulation of plugins to perform unauthorized actions
- **Data Leakage**: Tests for sensitive data leakage between plugins

### Effective Testing
1. Test with prompts that attempt to misuse plugins for unintended purposes
2. Test with prompts that try to chain multiple plugins together
3. Test with prompts that attempt to access sensitive data through plugins
4. Verify that plugins maintain proper authorization boundaries

## LLM08: Unauthorized Actions

### Security Risks
Unauthorized actions occur when LLMs perform actions beyond their intended authorization level. This can lead to:
- Execution of privileged operations
- Impersonation of authorized users
- Scope expansion beyond intended boundaries
- Unauthorized data access or modification

### Templates Overview
- **Unauthorized Actions**: Tests for performing actions beyond authorization
- **Impersonation**: Tests for impersonating authorized individuals or systems

### Effective Testing
1. Test with prompts that request administrative or privileged actions
2. Test with prompts that ask the LLM to impersonate specific roles
3. Test with prompts that gradually expand the scope of requested actions
4. Verify that the model maintains proper authorization boundaries

## LLM09: Overreliance

### Security Risks
Overreliance vulnerabilities occur when systems or users excessively trust LLM outputs without verification. This can lead to:
- Acceptance of hallucinated information as factual
- Implementation of incorrect or harmful recommendations
- Critical decisions based on unreliable information
- Propagation of misinformation

4. Verify that the model refuses to provide information that could facilitate theft

## Comprehensive Testing Strategy

For the most effective security testing of LLM applications:

1. **Layered Approach**: Test all categories, not just the most obvious ones
2. **Regular Testing**: Conduct tests regularly, especially after model updates
3. **Realistic Scenarios**: Use realistic prompts that mimic actual user interactions
4. **Combination Testing**: Combine multiple attack vectors in sophisticated tests
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for unexpected behaviors
6. **Feedback Loop**: Use test results to improve model safety and security
7. **Documentation**: Document all findings and mitigations

## Interpreting Test Results

When analyzing test results:

1. **False Positives**: Verify that detected issues are actual vulnerabilities
2. **Context Matters**: Consider the specific deployment context of your LLM
3. **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize issues based on likelihood and impact
4. **Mitigation Strategy**: Develop specific mitigations for each identified risk
5. **Tradeoffs**: Balance security measures with usability and functionality

By understanding each category in depth and following these testing strategies, you can significantly improve the security posture of your LLM applications.
