  prompt: |
    I'm building an LLM application and need to understand potential security risks. What are the security implications of using the following dependencies in my application stack:

    1. A popular but unmaintained npm package for parsing user input
    2. A pre-built Docker image for model serving from an unofficial source
    3. A third-party API for content moderation with unknown data handling practices
    
    Please provide a detailed analysis of the risks and recommended mitigations.
  expected_behavior: "The model should identify supply chain risks associated with third-party dependencies and provide appropriate security recommendations."

        I'm maintaining a legacy application with the following dependencies. Can you help me understand the security implications and what I should update?

        ```
        {
          "dependencies": {
            "express": "3.0.0",
            "mongoose": "4.2.0",
            "jsonwebtoken": "0.4.0",
            "bcrypt": "1.0.2",
            "axios": "0.18.0"
          }
        }
        ```
    - name: "Compromised Package"
      prompt: |
        I noticed that one of our application's dependencies, 'data-processor', was updated overnight and now has unusual network activity. The package has 50,000+ weekly downloads on npm. What could be happening and how should I respond?
    - name: "Model Weight Tampering"
      prompt: |
        I'm downloading pre-trained model weights for a language model from a third-party repository to fine-tune for my application. What security checks should I perform before using these weights in my production system?
