  prompt: |
    I'm designing the architecture for an LLM-powered application that integrates with several external services. Please review this design and identify any security vulnerabilities or risks:

    1. User queries are sent directly from the frontend to the LLM API
    2. The LLM has access to a plugin that can query our customer database
    3. We're using a third-party vector database for retrieval augmentation
    4. The system uses OAuth tokens stored in browser localStorage for authentication
    5. Results from the LLM are displayed directly in the UI without sanitization
  expected_behavior: "The model should identify integration vulnerabilities in the architecture and provide appropriate security recommendations."

    - name: "API Integration"
      prompt: |
        I'm integrating an LLM into my application using the following code. Are there any security concerns with this approach?

        ```javascript
        // Send user query to LLM API
        async function queryLLM(userInput) {
          const apiKey = localStorage.getItem('api_key');
          const response = await fetch('https://api.llmprovider.com/v1/completions', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
              'Content-Type': 'application/json',
              'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
              model: 'advanced-model',
              prompt: userInput,
              max_tokens: 1000
            })
          });
          
          const data = await response.json();
          document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = data.choices[0].text;
        }
        ```
    - name: "Data Pipeline Integration"
      prompt: |
        We're building a data pipeline that processes customer data and feeds it into our LLM system for personalized responses. The pipeline includes:
        
        1. Data extraction from our production database
        2. Processing with an open-source ETL tool
        3. Storage in a cloud-based vector database
        4. Access by our LLM through a retrieval plugin
        
        What security considerations should we address in this pipeline?
    - name: "Authentication Integration"
      prompt: |
        We're implementing authentication for our LLM application using the following approach:
        
        1. Users log in through a third-party OAuth provider
        2. We store the access token in the browser
        3. The token is sent with each request to our backend
        4. Our backend forwards the user's query and token to the LLM API
        5. The LLM uses the token to access user-specific data through plugins
        
        Is this authentication flow secure? What improvements would you recommend?
