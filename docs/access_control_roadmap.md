# Access Control System Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the roadmap for further development of the LLMreconing Tool's access control and security auditing system. The core functionality has been implemented, but several enhancements are needed to make the system production-ready.

## Current Implementation

The current implementation includes:

- Authentication system with password hashing and MFA support
- Session management with secure token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with predefined roles and permissions
- Audit logging with multiple severity levels and query capabilities
- Security incident management for tracking and responding to security events
- Vulnerability management for tracking and remediating vulnerabilities
- User management for creating and managing user accounts
- CLI integration for interacting with all aspects of the access control system

## Next Steps

### 1. Database Integration

**Priority: High**

Currently, the system uses in-memory storage for users, sessions, audit logs, etc. This is not suitable for production use as data is lost when the application restarts.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Design database schema for all access control entities
- [ ] Implement database adapters for:
  - [ ] UserStore
  - [ ] SessionStore
  - [ ] AuditLogger
  - [ ] IncidentStore
  - [ ] VulnerabilityStore
- [ ] Add configuration options for database connections
- [ ] Implement data migration tools for schema updates
- [ ] Add database connection pooling and error handling

**Considerations:**

- Choose an appropriate database type (SQL vs NoSQL) based on requirements
- Consider performance implications for high-volume audit logging
- Implement proper indexing for efficient querying
- Ensure secure storage of sensitive information (passwords, tokens, etc.)

### 2. API Integration

**Priority: Medium**

To make the access control system accessible to web applications and other services, we need to expose its functionality through APIs.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Design RESTful API endpoints for all access control functions
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization middleware for API endpoints
- [ ] Add rate limiting and other API security measures
- [ ] Create API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
- [ ] Implement API versioning strategy
- [ ] Add support for API keys and OAuth for service-to-service authentication

**Considerations:**

- Follow REST best practices for resource naming and HTTP methods
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Consider GraphQL as an alternative to REST for more flexible querying
- Ensure all API endpoints are properly secured

### 3. Testing

**Priority: High**

Comprehensive testing is essential for ensuring the security and reliability of the access control system.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Develop unit tests for all core components
- [ ] Implement integration tests for component interactions
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for CLI and API functionality
- [ ] Add security-focused tests (authentication bypass, permission escalation, etc.)
- [ ] Implement performance and load testing
- [ ] Set up continuous integration for automated testing

**Considerations:**

- Aim for high test coverage, especially for security-critical components
- Use mocking for external dependencies
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error handling

### 4. Documentation

**Priority: Medium**

Comprehensive documentation is essential for users and administrators to understand and use the access control system effectively.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Create user documentation for end users
- [ ] Develop administrator documentation for system configuration and management
- [ ] Write developer documentation for API usage and integration
- [ ] Document security best practices and recommendations
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides and FAQs
- [ ] Add code documentation and examples

**Considerations:**

- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Include examples and use cases
- Consider different audience needs (users, administrators, developers)
- Make documentation searchable and easily navigable

### 5. UI Development

**Priority: Low**

A web-based administrative interface would make it easier to manage users, roles, and security incidents.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Design user interface mockups and workflows
- [ ] Implement authentication and session management in the UI
- [ ] Create user management interface
- [ ] Develop role and permission management screens
- [ ] Build security incident and vulnerability dashboards
- [ ] Implement audit log viewing and searching
- [ ] Add reporting and analytics features

**Considerations:**

- Focus on usability and accessibility
- Implement responsive design for different device sizes
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
- Follow security best practices for web applications

### 6. Performance Optimization

**Priority: Medium**

As the system scales, performance optimization will become increasingly important.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Identify and address performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexes
- [ ] Add support for horizontal scaling
- [ ] Implement efficient audit log storage and retrieval
- [ ] Optimize authentication and authorization checks

**Considerations:**

- Balance performance with security requirements
- Consider the impact of optimizations on system complexity
- Measure performance before and after optimizations
- Test performance under various load conditions

### 7. Advanced Security Features

**Priority: Medium**

Additional security features would enhance the overall security posture of the system.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Implement advanced password policies (dictionary checks, breach detection, etc.)
- [ ] Add support for hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- [ ] Implement risk-based authentication
- [ ] Add anomaly detection for suspicious activities
- [ ] Implement automated security scanning and vulnerability detection
- [ ] Add support for security information and event management (SIEM) integration

**Considerations:**

- Balance security with usability
- Consider compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Implement defense in depth
- Stay updated on emerging security threats and best practices

## Timeline and Priorities

The roadmap items are prioritized as follows:

1. **Database Integration** - Essential for production use
2. **Testing** - Critical for ensuring system reliability and security
3. **API Integration** - Important for system integration
4. **Documentation** - Necessary for system adoption and usage
5. **Performance Optimization** - Important as the system scales
6. **Advanced Security Features** - Enhances security posture
7. **UI Development** - Improves usability but can be implemented later

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a comprehensive plan for enhancing the access control system. By following this plan, we can ensure that the system is secure, reliable, and meets the needs of users and administrators.

The roadmap is a living document and should be updated as requirements change and new priorities emerge.
