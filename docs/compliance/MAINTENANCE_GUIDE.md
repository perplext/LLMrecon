  - Existing documentation
  - Implemented controls
  - Compliance status
  - Resource requirements

- Document the assessment using the impact assessment template:
  ```
  Tools > Compliance > Impact Assessment > New
  Standard: [ISO/IEC 42001 or OWASP LLM Top 10]
  Change: [Description of the change]
  Affected Documentation: [List of affected documents]
  Affected Controls: [List of affected controls]
  Compliance Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
  Resource Requirements: [Estimated resources needed]
  ```

### 3. Update Planning

- Develop an update plan including:
  - Documentation changes required
  - Control implementation changes
  - Testing requirements
  - Timeline and milestones
  - Resource allocation

- Create an update plan using the planning tool:
  ```
  Tools > Compliance > Update Planning > New
  Impact Assessment ID: [Reference to impact assessment]
  Timeline: [Start and end dates]
  Milestones: [Key milestones]
  Resources: [Assigned personnel and budget]
  Approvals: [Required approvals]
  ```

### 4. Implementation

- Update documentation according to the plan

### 6. Approval and Communication

- Obtain approval from the AI Governance Committee
- Communicate changes to relevant stakeholders
- Update the compliance status dashboard
- Archive previous versions of documentation

## Version Control

### Documentation Versioning

- Use semantic versioning for all compliance documents:
  - Major version: Significant changes to content or structure
  - Minor version: Updates that don't change the overall approach
  - Patch: Minor corrections or clarifications

- Example version control table:

| Document | Current Version | Last Updated | Next Review | Owner |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| ISO/IEC 42001 Implementation Guide | 1.2.3 | 2025-03-15 | 2025-06-15 | Compliance Manager |
| OWASP LLM Top 10 Security Controls | 2.0.1 | 2025-04-10 | 2025-07-10 | Security Team |
| Compliance Checklists | 1.1.0 | 2025-02-28 | 2025-05-28 | Compliance Manager |
