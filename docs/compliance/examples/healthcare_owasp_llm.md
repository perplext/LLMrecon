# Healthcare Implementation Example: OWASP LLM Top 10

## Overview

This document provides a practical example of how a healthcare organization can implement security controls to address the OWASP LLM Top 10 vulnerabilities using the LLMrecon tool. The example focuses on a healthcare provider that uses LLMs for patient support, clinical decision support, and administrative tasks.

## Organization Profile: MediCare Health

**Organization Type:** Healthcare Provider  
**Size:** 1,000 employees  
**AI Applications:**
- Patient support chatbots
- Clinical decision support systems
- Medical documentation assistance
- Administrative workflow automation

## Security Implementation

### LLM01: Prompt Injection Protection

#### Risk Context for Healthcare
In healthcare settings, prompt injection attacks could lead to unauthorized access to patient data, incorrect medical advice, or manipulation of clinical decision support systems.
