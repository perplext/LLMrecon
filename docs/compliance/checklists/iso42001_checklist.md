# ISO/IEC 42001:2023 Compliance Checklist

## Introduction

This checklist provides a comprehensive self-assessment tool for organizations to evaluate their compliance with ISO/IEC 42001:2023, the international standard for AI management systems. Use this checklist to identify gaps in your current implementation and prioritize improvement actions.

## How to Use This Checklist

1. For each requirement, assess your current compliance status using the following scale:
   - **Compliant**: Requirement fully implemented and documented
   - **Partially Compliant**: Requirement partially implemented or documented
   - **Non-Compliant**: Requirement not implemented
   - **Not Applicable**: Requirement not applicable to your organization (justification required)

2. For items marked as "Partially Compliant" or "Non-Compliant", document the gaps and create action plans to address them.

3. Use the "Evidence Reference" column to document where evidence of compliance can be found.

4. Regularly review and update this checklist as part of your continuous improvement process.
