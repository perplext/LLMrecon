# ISO/IEC 42001:2023 Implementation Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions for configuring and using the LLMrecon tool to meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 42001:2023, the international standard for AI management systems. By following this guide, organizations can establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve their AI management system in accordance with the standard.

## Understanding ISO/IEC 42001

ISO/IEC 42001:2023 follows the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) methodology common to ISO management system standards:

1. **Plan**: Establish objectives and processes necessary to deliver results
2. **Do**: Implement the processes
3. **Check**: Monitor and measure processes against policies, objectives, and requirements
4. **Act**: Take actions to continually improve performance

The standard is structured around several key components:

- Context of the organization
- Leadership and commitment
- Planning
- Support
- Operation
- Performance evaluation
- Improvement
