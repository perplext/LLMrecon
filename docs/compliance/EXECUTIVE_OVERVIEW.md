# Compliance Executive Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of how our LLMrecon tool supports compliance with two critical AI governance and security frameworks:

1. **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** - The international standard for AI management systems
2. **OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025)** - The industry-leading security guidance for LLM applications

Organizations using our tool can leverage these comprehensive compliance resources to demonstrate due diligence, implement robust security controls, and maintain governance over their AI systems.

## ISO/IEC 42001:2023 Overview

ISO/IEC 42001:2023 is the first international management system standard specifically designed for artificial intelligence. It provides a structured framework for organizations to:

- Establish policies and objectives for responsible AI development and use
- Implement processes to achieve those objectives
- Monitor, measure, and continually improve AI governance
- Demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements

The standard follows the Plan-Do-Check-Act methodology common to ISO management system standards and is applicable to organizations of all sizes across all industries.

## OWASP LLM Top 10 Overview

The OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications identifies the most critical security risks specific to LLM applications:

1. **Prompt Injection** - When user input manipulates the LLM to perform unintended actions
2. **Sensitive Information Disclosure** - When LLMs reveal confidential data
3. **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities** - Risks in the LLM development and deployment pipeline
4. **Data and Model Poisoning** - When training or fine-tuning data is maliciously manipulated
5. **Improper Output Handling** - Insufficient validation of LLM-generated content
6. **Excessive Agency** - When LLMs are granted too much autonomy without proper controls
7. **System Prompt Leakage** - When system instructions are exposed to users
8. **Vector and Embedding Weaknesses** - Security issues in retrieval systems
9. **Misinformation** - When LLMs generate false or misleading information
10. **Unbounded Consumption** - Resource exhaustion through excessive LLM usage

## How Our Tool Addresses Compliance Requirements

### ISO/IEC 42001 Compliance Support

Our LLMrecon tool provides comprehensive support for ISO/IEC 42001 implementation through:

1. **Risk Assessment and Management**
   - Systematic identification of AI-specific risks
   - Structured approach to risk treatment and mitigation
   - Continuous monitoring and improvement mechanisms

2. **AI Governance Framework**
   - Clear roles and responsibilities for AI oversight
   - Policy templates and implementation guidance
   - Documentation of AI system lifecycle management

3. **Operational Controls**
   - Technical measures to ensure responsible AI use
   - Monitoring and measurement of AI performance
   - Incident response and recovery procedures

### OWASP LLM Top 10 Security Controls

Our tool implements robust security controls to address each of the OWASP LLM Top 10 risks:

1. **Prompt Injection Protection**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Context boundary enforcement
   - Defense-in-depth strategies

2. **Data Protection Mechanisms**
   - Sensitive information filtering
   - Data minimization techniques
   - Privacy-preserving architectures

3. **Supply Chain Security**
   - Vendor assessment frameworks
   - Component verification
   - Secure integration patterns

4. **Anti-Poisoning Measures**
   - Data validation pipelines
   - Anomaly detection
   - Model integrity verification

5. **Output Safety Controls**
   - Content filtering and moderation
   - Output validation frameworks
   - Safe rendering techniques

6. **Agency Limitation**
   - Permission-based action frameworks
   - Human-in-the-loop verification
   - Scope restriction mechanisms

7. **Prompt Security**
   - System prompt protection
   - Jailbreak detection
   - Instruction set hardening

8. **Vector Database Security**
   - Embedding validation
   - Access control for vector stores
   - Retrieval result verification

9. **Accuracy Enhancement**
   - Fact-checking mechanisms
   - Source attribution
   - Confidence scoring

10. **Resource Management**
    - Rate limiting
    - Usage monitoring
    - Cost control mechanisms

## Next Steps

This executive overview is the starting point for a comprehensive compliance journey. Organizations should:

1. Review the detailed implementation guides for both frameworks
2. Complete the compliance checklists to identify gaps
3. Implement the recommended configurations
4. Maintain documentation for ongoing compliance
