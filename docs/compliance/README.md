# Compliance Documentation Suite

## Overview

This documentation suite provides comprehensive guidance for organizations seeking to implement compliance with ISO/IEC 42001:2023 (AI Management Systems) and the OWASP LLM Top 10 security framework. The documentation is designed to support organizations at all stages of their compliance journey, from initial planning through implementation, verification, and continuous improvement.

## Documentation Structure

The compliance documentation is organized into the following sections:

- [Compliance Mapping](./COMPLIANCE_MAPPING.md) - Detailed mapping between tool features and specific compliance requirements
- [AI Governance Support](./AI_GOVERNANCE_SUPPORT.md) - Guidance on AI governance obligations and continuous improvement
- [Maintenance Guide](./MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md) - Procedures for keeping compliance documentation current as standards evolve

### ISO/IEC 42001 Documentation

- [Implementation Guide](./iso42001/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) - Detailed instructions for configuring the tool to meet ISO/IEC 42001 requirements
- Additional implementation resources in the [iso42001](./iso42001/) directory

### OWASP LLM Top 10 Documentation

- [Security Controls](./owasp-llm-top10/SECURITY_CONTROLS.md) - Detailed guidance for implementing security controls for each vulnerability
- Additional security resources in the [owasp-llm-top10](./owasp-llm-top10/) directory

### Assessment Tools

- [ISO/IEC 42001 Checklist](./checklists/iso42001_checklist.md) - Comprehensive self-assessment checklist for ISO/IEC 42001
- [OWASP LLM Top 10 Checklist](./checklists/owasp_llm_top10_checklist.md) - Security assessment checklist for OWASP LLM Top 10

### Implementation Examples

- [Financial Services ISO/IEC 42001 Example](./examples/finance_iso42001.md) - Example implementation for a financial services organization
- [Healthcare OWASP LLM Top 10 Example](./examples/healthcare_owasp_llm.md) - Example implementation for a healthcare organization
- Additional examples in the [examples](./examples/) directory

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Executives and Decision Makers

1. Start with the [Executive Overview](./EXECUTIVE_OVERVIEW.md) to understand the value proposition and high-level requirements
2. Review the [AI Governance Support](./AI_GOVERNANCE_SUPPORT.md) document to understand governance implications
3. Use the [Compliance Mapping](./COMPLIANCE_MAPPING.md) to identify how tool features address specific requirements

### For Implementation Teams

1. Begin with the appropriate implementation guide based on your focus:
   - [ISO/IEC 42001 Implementation Guide](./iso42001/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for AI management systems
   - [OWASP LLM Top 10 Security Controls](./owasp-llm-top10/SECURITY_CONTROLS.md) for security controls
2. Review relevant example implementations that match your industry or use case
3. Use the checklists to track implementation progress and identify gaps

### For Compliance and Audit Teams

1. Use the checklists to assess current compliance status:
   - [ISO/IEC 42001 Checklist](./checklists/iso42001_checklist.md)
   - [OWASP LLM Top 10 Checklist](./checklists/owasp_llm_top10_checklist.md)
2. Review the [Compliance Mapping](./COMPLIANCE_MAPPING.md) to understand how controls map to requirements
3. Leverage the [Maintenance Guide](./MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md) to establish ongoing compliance processes

## Implementation Approach

We recommend the following phased approach to implementing compliance:

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

1. Conduct a gap analysis using the provided checklists
2. Identify priority areas based on risk and compliance requirements
3. Develop an implementation roadmap with clear milestones
4. Establish governance structures and responsibilities

### Phase 2: Implementation

1. Configure the tool according to the implementation guides
2. Implement required controls and processes
3. Develop necessary documentation
4. Train personnel on new processes and requirements

### Phase 3: Verification and Improvement

1. Conduct internal assessments using the checklists
2. Address any identified gaps
3. Prepare for external audits or certifications
4. Establish continuous improvement processes

## Keeping Documentation Current

The [Maintenance Guide](./MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md) provides detailed procedures for:

1. Monitoring for changes to standards and regulations
2. Assessing the impact of changes on compliance status
3. Updating documentation and controls as needed
4. Maintaining version control and change history
5. Communicating changes to stakeholders
