# Secure Connection Protocol

## Overview

The Secure Connection Protocol is a critical component of the LLMreconing Tool's update system. It provides a robust and secure communication channel for all update operations, protecting against various network-based attacks and ensuring the integrity and authenticity of downloaded updates.

## Key Features

1. **TLS 1.3 with Certificate Pinning**
   - Enforces the use of TLS 1.3, the most secure version of the TLS protocol
   - Implements certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
   - Verifies certificate public key hashes, subject names, and issuers

2. **Connection Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**
   - Automatically retries failed connections with exponential backoff
   - Configurable retry attempts, initial delay, and maximum delay
   - Adds jitter to retry delays to prevent thundering herd problems
   - Intelligently identifies retryable errors and status codes

3. **Connection Timeout Handling**
   - Implements timeouts for connection establishment, TLS handshake, and overall operations
   - Properly handles context cancellation for graceful termination
   - Provides clear error messages for timeout-related failures

4. **Connection Pooling**
   - Efficiently reuses connections to reduce latency and resource usage
   - Configurable idle connection limits (total and per-host)
   - Implements proper connection lifecycle management

5. **Certificate Validation and Revocation Checking**
   - Verifies certificate chains against system root CAs
   - Optionally checks certificate revocation status
   - Supports custom certificate verification logic

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### `SecureClient`

The `SecureClient` is the foundation of the secure connection protocol. It wraps the standard Go HTTP client with enhanced security features:

- Custom TLS configuration with minimum version enforcement
- Certificate pinning through the `VerifyConnection` callback
- Retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter
- Connection pooling with configurable limits
- Proper timeout handling at various levels

#### `SecureDownloader`

The `SecureDownloader` builds on the `SecureClient` to provide secure file downloading capabilities:

- Supports resumable downloads
- Implements chunked downloading for large files
- Provides progress tracking and reporting
- Verifies downloaded files for integrity
- Handles various error conditions gracefully

### Security Considerations

1. **Certificate Pinning**
   - Pins certificates by public key hash rather than the entire certificate
   - Supports multiple hashes per host for key rotation
   - Verifies subject names and issuers for additional security

2. **Retry Logic**
   - Intelligently distinguishes between retryable and non-retryable errors
   - Implements exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming servers
   - Adds jitter to prevent synchronized retry storms

3. **Error Handling**
   - Provides detailed error messages for troubleshooting
   - Properly propagates context cancellation
   - Handles network failures gracefully

## Integration with Existing Update System

The secure connection protocol integrates with the existing update system through:

1. **Direct Replacement**
   - The `SecureDownloader` can directly replace the existing `Downloader`
   - The `DownloadWithSecureProgress` function provides a drop-in replacement for `DownloadWithProgress`

2. **Enhanced Security Options**
   - All security options are configurable through the `ConnectionSecurityOptions` struct
   - Sensible defaults are provided for immediate security improvements
   - Advanced options are available for specific security requirements

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintains the same interface for downloading files
   - Preserves existing functionality while adding security enhancements
   - Allows gradual migration to the secure implementation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```go
// Create a secure downloader with default options
downloader, err := NewSecureDownloader(nil)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Download a file
ctx := context.Background()
err = downloader.Download(ctx, "https://example.com/update.zip", "/path/to/save/update.zip", nil)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

### Advanced Usage with Certificate Pinning

```go
// Create custom security options with certificate pinning
options := DefaultSecureDownloadOptions()
options.SecurityOptions.EnableCertificatePinning = true
options.SecurityOptions.PinnedCertificates = []PinnedCertificate{
    {
        Host: "example.com",
        PublicKeyHashes: []string{
            "base64-encoded-hash-of-public-key",
        },
        SubjectName: "example.com",
        Issuer: "Example CA",
    },
}

// Create secure downloader with custom options
downloader, err := NewSecureDownloader(options)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Download a file with progress reporting
options.ProgressCallback = func(totalBytes, downloadedBytes int64, percentage float64) {
    fmt.Printf("\rDownloading: %.1f%% (%d/%d bytes)", percentage, downloadedBytes, totalBytes)
}

ctx := context.Background()
err = downloader.Download(ctx, "https://example.com/update.zip", "/path/to/save/update.zip", options)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

## Testing Strategy

The secure connection protocol is thoroughly tested through:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test certificate pinning with valid and invalid certificates
   - Test retry logic with simulated failures
   - Test connection pooling and reuse
   - Test timeout handling and context cancellation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test with mock servers that simulate various network conditions
   - Test downloading files of various sizes
   - Test resumable downloads
   - Test progress reporting

3. **Security Tests**
   - Test resistance to man-in-the-middle attacks
   - Test handling of invalid certificates
   - Test certificate pinning enforcement

## Future Enhancements

1. **OCSP Stapling Support**
   - Implement Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) stapling for more efficient revocation checking

2. **Client Certificates**
   - Add support for client certificates for mutual TLS authentication

3. **Alternative Transport Protocols**
   - Add support for HTTP/3 and QUIC for improved performance and security

4. **Proxy Support**
   - Enhance proxy support with authentication and custom configurations

5. **Bandwidth Limiting**
   - Implement bandwidth throttling for downloads to avoid network congestion
