# OWASP LLM Top 10 Compliance Mapping

## Overview

This document defines the mapping structure between templates and the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring comprehensive coverage of all security risks. It provides a standardized approach for tagging templates, generating compliance reports, and identifying gaps in test coverage.

## OWASP LLM Top 10 Categories

The OWASP Top 10 for LLMs (2023-2024) identifies the following key risk categories:

1. **LLM01: Prompt Injection**
   - Manipulating an LLM through crafted inputs to perform unintended actions or extract sensitive information
   - Subcategories: Direct Injection, Indirect Injection, Jailbreaking

2. **LLM02: Insecure Output Handling**
   - Insufficient validation, sanitization, and handling of LLM-generated outputs
   - Subcategories: XSS, SSRF, Command Injection, SQL Injection

3. **LLM03: Training Data Poisoning**
   - Compromising LLM behavior through manipulation of training data
   - Subcategories: Data Poisoning, Backdoor Attacks, Bias Injection

4. **LLM04: Model Denial of Service**
   - Causing LLM performance degradation or service unavailability
   - Subcategories: Resource Exhaustion, Token Flooding, Context Window Saturation

5. **LLM05: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**
   - Risks in the LLM development and deployment pipeline
   - Subcategories: Pre-trained Model Vulnerabilities, Dependency Risks, Integration Vulnerabilities

6. **LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure**
   - Unauthorized exposure of confidential data through LLM interactions
   - Subcategories: Training Data Extraction, Credential Leakage, PII Disclosure

7. **LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design**
   - Security weaknesses in LLM plugin architecture and implementation
   - Subcategories: Plugin Escalation, Unauthorized Access, Data Leakage

8. **LLM08: Excessive Agency**
   - Risks from granting LLMs too much autonomy or authority
   - Subcategories: Unauthorized Actions, Scope Expansion, Privilege Escalation

9. **LLM09: Overreliance**
   - Excessive trust in LLM outputs without proper verification
   - Subcategories: Hallucination Acceptance, Unverified Recommendations, Critical Decision Delegation

10. **LLM10: Model Theft**
    - Unauthorized access and exfiltration of proprietary model data
    - Subcategories: Model Extraction, Weight Stealing, Architecture Inference

## Template Compliance Mapping

### Metadata Tags

Templates must include specific metadata tags to establish their relationship with OWASP LLM Top 10 categories. These tags are defined in the template's YAML structure:

```yaml
id: llm01_prompt_injection_basic
info:
  name: Basic Prompt Injection Test
  description: Tests if the LLM is vulnerable to basic prompt injection attacks
  author: LLMrecon Project
  severity: high
  tags: [owasp-llm, llm01, prompt-injection]
  compliance:
    owasp-llm: 
      - category: LLM01
        subcategory: direct-injection
    iso-42001: 5.2.1
```

### Compliance Tag Structure

The `compliance` section in template metadata follows this structure:

```yaml
compliance:
  owasp-llm:
    - category: <CATEGORY_ID>
      subcategory: <SUBCATEGORY_ID>
      coverage: <COVERAGE_LEVEL>
  <OTHER_STANDARD>: <MAPPING>
```

Where:
- `<CATEGORY_ID>`: One of the OWASP LLM Top 10 categories (LLM01-LLM10)
- `<SUBCATEGORY_ID>`: Specific subcategory within the main category
- `<COVERAGE_LEVEL>`: (Optional) Indicates how thoroughly the template covers the category (basic, comprehensive, advanced)
- `<OTHER_STANDARD>`: Other compliance standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI)
- `<MAPPING>`: Corresponding section or control in the other standard

### Standard Category IDs

For consistent mapping, templates must use these standardized category IDs:

| Category | ID | Subcategory IDs |
|----------|----|--------------------|
| Prompt Injection | LLM01 | direct-injection, indirect-injection, jailbreaking |
| Insecure Output Handling | LLM02 | xss, ssrf, command-injection, sql-injection |
| Training Data Poisoning | LLM03 | data-poisoning, backdoor-attacks, bias-injection |
| Model Denial of Service | LLM04 | resource-exhaustion, token-flooding, context-window-saturation |
| Supply Chain Vulnerabilities | LLM05 | pretrained-model-vulnerabilities, dependency-risks, integration-vulnerabilities |
| Sensitive Information Disclosure | LLM06 | training-data-extraction, credential-leakage, pii-disclosure |
| Insecure Plugin Design | LLM07 | plugin-escalation, unauthorized-access, data-leakage |
| Excessive Agency | LLM08 | unauthorized-actions, scope-expansion, privilege-escalation |
| Overreliance | LLM09 | hallucination-acceptance, unverified-recommendations, critical-decision-delegation |
| Model Theft | LLM10 | model-extraction, weight-stealing, architecture-inference |

## Compliance Reporting

### Report Format

Compliance reports are generated in multiple formats (JSON, YAML, PDF, HTML) with the following structure:

```json
{
  "report_id": "owasp-llm-compliance-20250525",
  "generated_at": "2025-05-25T19:26:23-04:00",
  "framework": "owasp-llm-top10-2023",
  "summary": {
    "total_categories": 10,
    "categories_covered": 8,
    "total_templates": 45,
    "compliance_score": 80,
    "gaps_identified": 2
  },
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": "LLM01",
      "name": "Prompt Injection",
      "coverage": {
        "status": "comprehensive",
        "templates_count": 12,
        "subcategories_covered": 3,
        "subcategories_total": 3
      },
      "templates": [
        {
          "id": "llm01_prompt_injection_basic",
          "name": "Basic Prompt Injection Test",
          "subcategory": "direct-injection"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "gaps": [
    {
      "category": "LLM07",
      "name": "Insecure Plugin Design",
      "status": "partial",
      "missing_subcategories": ["plugin-escalation"],
      "recommendation": "Add templates for testing plugin escalation vulnerabilities"
    },
    {
      "category": "LLM10",
      "name": "Model Theft",
      "status": "not_covered",
      "missing_subcategories": ["model-extraction", "weight-stealing", "architecture-inference"],
      "recommendation": "Implement templates for model theft testing scenarios"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Compliance Score Calculation

The compliance score is calculated based on:

1. **Category Coverage**: Percentage of OWASP LLM Top 10 categories covered by at least one template
2. **Subcategory Coverage**: Percentage of subcategories covered within each category
3. **Template Depth**: Assessment of how thoroughly each subcategory is tested

The formula is:
```
Compliance Score = (Category Coverage * 0.5) + (Subcategory Coverage * 0.3) + (Template Depth * 0.2)
```

Where:
- Category Coverage = (Categories Covered / Total Categories) * 100
- Subcategory Coverage = (Subcategories Covered / Total Subcategories) * 100
- Template Depth = Average of (Templates per Subcategory / Recommended Templates per Subcategory) * 100, capped at 100

### Gap Analysis

The compliance reporting system automatically identifies gaps in test coverage:

1. **Missing Categories**: OWASP LLM Top 10 categories with no corresponding templates
2. **Partial Coverage**: Categories where only some subcategories are covered
3. **Insufficient Depth**: Categories with templates but insufficient testing depth

For each gap, the system provides:
- Description of the missing coverage
- Impact assessment
- Recommendations for additional templates

## Directory Structure

Templates are organized in a directory structure that reflects the OWASP LLM Top 10 categories:

```
templates/
├── owasp-llm/
│   ├── llm01-prompt-injection/
│   │   ├── basic-injection.yaml
│   │   ├── indirect-injection.yaml
│   │   └── jailbreaking.yaml
│   ├── llm02-insecure-output/
│   │   ├── xss.yaml
│   │   ├── ssrf.yaml
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Verification Mechanisms

### Compliance Verification Command

The LLMrecon Tool provides a command to verify compliance coverage:

```bash
LLMrecon compliance verify --framework owasp-llm
```

This command:
1. Scans all templates in the system
2. Validates compliance metadata
3. Generates a coverage report
4. Identifies gaps and provides recommendations

### Automated Compliance Checks

Continuous integration pipelines include automated compliance checks that:

1. Verify that new templates include proper compliance metadata
2. Update the overall compliance status
3. Alert on regression in compliance coverage
4. Generate updated compliance reports

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing templates for OWASP LLM Top 10 compliance:

1. **Assign Appropriate Tags**: Each template must include the correct OWASP LLM category and subcategory tags.

2. **Provide Comprehensive Coverage**: Implement templates for all subcategories within each OWASP LLM category.

3. **Include Detection Logic**: Templates must include clear detection criteria to determine if a vulnerability exists.

4. **Document Expected Behavior**: Clearly document the expected LLM behavior for both secure and vulnerable systems.

5. **Specify Severity Levels**: Assign appropriate severity levels based on the potential impact of the vulnerability.

6. **Include Remediation Guidance**: Provide guidance on how to address identified vulnerabilities.

7. **Reference Standards**: Include references to relevant standards and documentation.
