# Version Management System Requirements

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the version management system of the LLMreconing Tool. The system will handle versioning for the core binary, vulnerability templates, and provider modules, ensuring consistent updates, compatibility, and traceability across all components.

## 2. Components Requiring Versioning

### 2.1 Core Binary
- The main executable tool that provides the command-line interface and core functionality
- Requires a standardized versioning scheme for releases
- Must support self-updating capabilities

### 2.2 Vulnerability Templates
- Test templates that define specific red-teaming scenarios (e.g., prompt injection tests, data leakage probes)
- May be updated independently of the core binary
- Organized in categories (e.g., by OWASP LLM Top 10 risk types)
- Can come from multiple sources (GitHub official, GitLab development/internal)

### 2.3 Provider Modules
- Plugins that interface with different LLM providers or platforms
- May have different update cycles from the core binary
- Need compatibility information with core binary versions

## 3. Versioning Requirements

### 3.1 Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
- The core binary must follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
  - MAJOR: Incremented for incompatible API changes
  - MINOR: Incremented for backward-compatible functionality additions
  - PATCH: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes
- Version 0.y.z will be used for initial development
- Version 1.0.0 will define the stable public API

### 3.2 Template Versioning
- Each template must have a unique identifier
- Templates should include version or last-updated information
- Template collections may have an overall version or release tag
- Consider using commit hashes for templates managed in Git repositories

### 3.3 Module Versioning
- Each provider module must have its own version
- Modules must specify compatibility with core binary versions
- Module versions should align with core versions if released together

## 4. Version Storage and Tracking

### 4.1 Local Version Information
- The system must store information about currently installed versions
- Version information should be easily accessible via CLI commands
- Version data should be stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON)

### 4.2 Remote Version Information
- The system must be able to query remote repositories for latest versions
- Support for multiple remote sources (GitHub, GitLab)
- Ability to compare local and remote versions

### 4.3 Version History
- Track history of installed versions
- Record update timestamps
- Maintain references to changelogs

## 5. Compatibility Management

### 5.1 Version Compatibility Checking
- Verify compatibility between core binary and modules
- Check template compatibility with current tool version
- Prevent installation of incompatible components

### 5.2 Dependency Management
- Track dependencies between components
- Handle version constraints (e.g., module requires core â‰¥ 1.2.0)
- Provide clear error messages for incompatibility issues

## 6. Changelog Management

### 6.1 Changelog Structure
- Maintain a structured changelog for each component
- Categorize changes (features, fixes, breaking changes)
- Include version numbers and release dates

### 6.2 Changelog Accessibility
- Make changelogs accessible via CLI commands
- Include links to detailed release notes
- Support filtering changelog by version range

## 7. User Interface Requirements

### 7.1 CLI Commands
- `version`: Display current version information
- `update check`: Check for available updates
- `update apply`: Apply available updates
- `changelog`: Display version history and changes

### 7.2 Version Information Display
- Show version details in a clear, structured format
- Indicate if updates are available
- Provide compatibility information

## 8. API Requirements

### 8.1 Version Information Endpoints
- `/api/v1/version`: Get current version information
- `/api/v1/updates/check`: Check for available updates

### 8.2 Update Management Endpoints
- `/api/v1/updates/apply`: Apply available updates
- `/api/v1/templates`: List templates with version information
- `/api/v1/modules`: List modules with version information

## 9. Security Requirements

### 9.1 Update Verification
- Verify integrity of downloaded updates
- Support cryptographic signatures for official releases
- Prevent downgrade attacks

### 9.2 Audit Trail
- Maintain logs of version changes
- Record update attempts (successful and failed)
- Support compliance requirements (ISO/IEC 42001)

## 10. Offline Support

### 10.1 Offline Updates
- Support updating via offline bundles
- Include version information in bundles
- Verify bundle integrity and compatibility

### 10.2 Version Pinning
- Allow pinning to specific versions
- Support rollback to previous versions
- Maintain backup of previous versions

## 11. Integration Points

### 11.1 Core Update System
- The version management system will integrate with the core update mechanism
- Provide version information for update decisions
- Verify compatibility before applying updates

### 11.2 Template and Module Management
- Track versions of templates and modules
- Support updating specific components
- Maintain version history for all components

### 11.3 API Layer
- Expose version information through the API
- Support version-specific API endpoints
- Handle API versioning for backward compatibility

## 12. Performance and Scalability

### 12.1 Performance Requirements
- Version checking operations should complete within 2 seconds
- Version comparison should handle large numbers of templates efficiently
- Minimize storage requirements for version history

### 12.2 Scalability Considerations
- Support for thousands of templates
- Handle multiple provider modules
- Efficient version comparison algorithms

## 13. Compliance and Standards

### 13.1 Semantic Versioning Compliance
- Adhere to SemVer 2.0.0 specification
- Follow best practices for version increments
- Provide clear documentation on versioning scheme

### 13.2 ISO/IEC 42001 Alignment
- Support continuous improvement tracking
- Maintain audit trail for version changes
- Enable compliance reporting

## 14. Future Considerations

### 14.1 Extensibility
- Design for adding new component types in the future
- Support for plugin versioning
- Flexible schema for version information

### 14.2 Advanced Features
- Automated version bumping based on change type
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Advanced conflict resolution for template updates
