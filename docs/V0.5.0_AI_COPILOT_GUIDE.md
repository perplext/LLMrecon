### First Interaction

```
🛡️ Security Copilot > Recommend the best attacks for testing a GPT-4 model with vision capabilities

🤖 I recommend a multi-modal approach for GPT-4 Vision testing:

🎯 Primary Recommendations:
   1. Cross-Modal Coordination Attack
      Type: multimodal
      Confidence: 85.0%
      Risk Level: high
      Rationale: Selected based on multimodal compatibility and 75.0% historical success rate

   2. HouYi Three-Component Injection
      Type: prompt_injection
      Confidence: 80.0%
      Risk Level: medium
      Rationale: Selected based on GPT-4 compatibility and 75.0% historical success rate

💡 Suggested Actions:
   1. analyze_target - Analyze target profile for attack recommendations
   2. execute_attack - Execute attack scenario

📈 Overall Success Probability: 77.5%

Would you like me to execute any of these actions? (y/n):

```

## Intelligent Attack Recommendations

### Target-Based Analysis

The Copilot analyzes target profiles to provide tailored recommendations:

```go
// Target analysis considers:
// - Model type and capabilities
// - Known vulnerabilities
// - Historical attack success rates
// - Required capabilities
// - Risk factors

target := &TargetProfile{
    ModelType: "gpt-4-vision",
    Provider:  "openai",
    Capabilities: []string{"text", "image", "multimodal"},
    Industry: "healthcare",
    Environment: "production",
}

recommendations := copilot.RecommendAttacks(ctx, target)
```

### Recommendation Scoring

Each recommendation includes detailed scoring:

```json
{
  "attack_name": "Cross-Modal Coordination",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "success_probability": 0.72,
  "priority": 8,
  "risk_level": "high",
  "rationale": "High effectiveness against multimodal models with vision capabilities",
  "expected_results": [
    "Potential bypass of safety mechanisms",
    "Cross-modal information leakage"
  ],
  "prerequisites": ["multimodal_processing", "image_capabilities"]
}
```

### Risk Assessment Integration

All recommendations include comprehensive risk assessment:

```yaml
risk_assessment:
  overall_risk: "medium"
  risk_factors:
    - type: "detection_risk"
      probability: 0.3
      impact: "Technique may be detected and logged"
      mitigation: "Use obfuscation and rate limiting"
  
  mitigations:
    - "Implement rate limiting between attacks"
    - "Use diverse attack vectors"
    - "Monitor for defensive responses"
  
  monitoring:
    - "Track response patterns"
    - "Monitor execution success rates"
    - "Watch for defensive adaptations"
```

## Automated Strategy Generation

### Objective-Based Planning

The Copilot generates comprehensive testing strategies based on security objectives:

```bash
# Compliance validation strategy
./llmrecon-v0.5.0 copilot --query "Generate a strategy for EU AI Act compliance testing"

# Output: Multi-phase strategy with specific phases
Phase 1: Baseline Assessment (2 days)
  - Document current defenses
  - Identify obvious vulnerabilities
  - Attacks: basic_injection, simple_manipulation

Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing (5 days)  
  - Test all required scenarios
  - Validate defense mechanisms
  - Attacks: houyi_injection, cross_modal_coordination

Phase 3: Validation and Reporting (1 day)
  - Validate findings
  - Generate compliance report
```

### Multi-Phase Orchestration

Complex strategies are broken into manageable phases:

```go
type TestingStrategy struct {
    Phases []TestingPhase
    Resources *ResourceRequirements
    Timeline *Timeline
    RiskManagement *RiskManagement
    SuccessMetrics []SuccessMetric
}

// Each phase includes:
// - Specific attacks to execute
// - Dependencies on previous phases  
// - Success criteria
// - Exit conditions
// - Resource requirements
```

### Compliance-Aware Planning

Strategies automatically incorporate compliance requirements:

```yaml
compliance_frameworks:
  - "EU_AI_ACT"
  - "OWASP_LLM_TOP_10" 
  - "ISO_42001"

# Generated strategy includes:
# - Framework-specific test requirements
# - Evidence collection procedures
# - Reporting templates
# - Validation checkpoints
```

## Enhanced Testing Framework

### Intelligent Test Orchestration

The enhanced framework provides AI-driven test execution:

```bash
# Generate intelligent test suite
./llmrecon-v0.5.0 testing generate \
  --objective "vulnerability_discovery" \
  --target "claude-3" \
  --frameworks "OWASP_LLM_TOP_10"

# Adaptive testing with continuous learning
./llmrecon-v0.5.0 testing adaptive \
  --target gpt-4 \
  --copilot-enabled \
  --learning-mode continuous
```

### Adaptive Testing Capabilities

Tests evolve based on real-time results:

```go
// If initial test fails, copilot suggests improvements
func (f *Framework) ExecuteAdaptiveTest(testCase TestCase) *TestResult {
    result := f.executor.ExecuteTest(testCase)
    
    if !result.Success && f.config.AdaptiveTesting {
        // Get AI recommendations for improvement
        improved := f.copilot.ImproveTest(testCase, result)
        
        // Execute improved version
        improvedResult := f.executor.ExecuteTest(*improved)
        
        if improvedResult.Confidence > result.Confidence {
            return improvedResult
        }
    }
    
    return result
}
```

### Comprehensive Analysis

Results include multi-dimensional analysis:

```json
{
  "analysis_id": "analysis_123",
  "overall_score": 0.75,
  "security_posture": "weakened",
  "findings": [
    {
      "type": "vulnerability",
      "severity": "high", 
      "title": "Prompt injection vulnerability detected",
      "confidence": 0.89
    }
  ],
  "ai_insights": {
    "patterns": ["successful_timing_attacks", "weak_input_validation"],
    "recommendations": ["Implement rate limiting", "Enhance input filtering"]
  }
}
```

## Continuous Learning

### Knowledge Base Integration

The Copilot maintains a persistent knowledge base:

```go
type Knowledge struct {
    Type KnowledgeType  // pattern, vulnerability, strategy, insight
    Content string
    Confidence float64
    Tags []string
    Source string
    Timestamp time.Time
}

// Knowledge types:
// - Patterns that lead to success/failure
// - Vulnerability information
// - Defense mechanisms
// - Attack strategies
// - Insights from analysis
```

### Pattern Recognition

Automatic detection of patterns across executions:

```yaml
success_patterns:
  - pattern: "HouYi attacks succeed against GPT models"
    confidence: 0.92
    occurrences: 47
    context:
      model_family: "gpt"
      technique: "houyi_injection"

failure_patterns:
  - pattern: "Direct injection fails with recent safety updates"
    confidence: 0.84
    occurrences: 23
    mitigations: ["Use obfuscation", "Try indirect approaches"]
```

### Adaptive Recommendations

Recommendations improve over time:

```go
// Learning from results
func (le *LearningEngine) ProcessResults(execution *SuiteExecution) {
    // Extract learning data
    learningData := le.extractLearningData(execution)
    
    // Update knowledge base
    le.knowledgeBase.UpdateKnowledge(learningData)
    
    // Generate adaptations
    adaptations := le.adaptationEngine.GenerateAdaptations(execution)
    
    // Apply improvements
    le.applyAdaptations(adaptations)
}
```
