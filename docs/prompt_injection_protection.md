# Prompt Injection Protection System

## Overview

The Prompt Injection Protection System is a comprehensive security framework designed to protect LLM-based applications from various prompt injection attacks and other security threats. It provides multiple layers of protection, detection, monitoring, and reporting to ensure the security and integrity of LLM interactions.

## Key Components

### 1. Enhanced Context Boundary Enforcer

The Enhanced Context Boundary Enforcer (`EnhancedContextBoundaryEnforcer`) enforces strict boundaries between different parts of a prompt, preventing attackers from manipulating system instructions or context.

Features:
- Multi-level boundary enforcement
- Context isolation
- Delimiter protection
- Role preservation
- Custom boundary rules

### 2. Advanced Jailbreak Detector

The Advanced Jailbreak Detector (`AdvancedJailbreakDetector`) identifies and blocks sophisticated jailbreak attempts that try to bypass LLM restrictions.

Features:
- Semantic pattern detection
- Contextual analysis
- Emerging technique detection
- Multi-stage detection process
- Confidence scoring

### 3. Enhanced Pattern Library

The Enhanced Pattern Library (`EnhancedInjectionPatternLibrary`) maintains a comprehensive database of known prompt injection patterns and techniques.

Features:
- Pattern categorization
- Pattern statistics
- Custom pattern support
- Emerging pattern detection
- Pattern validation

### 4. Enhanced Content Filter

The Enhanced Content Filter (`EnhancedContentFilter`) filters out harmful or malicious content from LLM responses.

Features:
- Multi-category filtering
- Content transformation
- Adaptive filtering
- Confidence-based filtering
- Custom filter rules

### 5. Advanced Template Monitor

The Advanced Template Monitor (`AdvancedTemplateMonitor`) provides real-time monitoring of template usage and detects unusual patterns or behaviors.

Features:
- Usage pattern analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Real-time alerting
- Template statistics
- User behavior monitoring

### 6. Enhanced Approval Workflow

The Enhanced Approval Workflow (`EnhancedApprovalWorkflow`) manages the approval process for high-risk operations.

Features:
- Risk-based approval routing
- Auto-approval rules
- Approval history tracking
- Multi-level approval
- Custom approval handlers

### 7. Enhanced Reporting System

The Enhanced Reporting System (`EnhancedReportingSystem`) provides comprehensive reporting of prompt injection attempts and other security threats.

Features:
- Detailed reporting
- Report categorization
- Report analysis
- Report sharing
- Custom report handlers

## Integration

The Enhanced Protection Manager (`EnhancedProtectionManager`) integrates all these components into a unified protection system.

Features:
- Centralized configuration
- Component management
- Protection level settings
- Comprehensive protection APIs
- Monitoring and reporting integration

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```go
// Create protection config
config := prompt.DefaultProtectionConfig()
config.Level = prompt.LevelMedium

// Create enhanced protection manager
manager, err := prompt.NewEnhancedProtectionManager(config)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to create enhanced protection manager: %v", err)
}
defer manager.Close()

// Protect a prompt
protectedPrompt, result, err := manager.ProtectPromptEnhanced(ctx, userPrompt, userID, sessionID, templateID)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to protect prompt: %v", err)
}

// Check result
if result.ActionTaken == prompt.ActionBlocked {
    fmt.Println("Prompt was blocked due to security concerns")
} else {
    // Use protected prompt
    fmt.Println("Protected prompt:", protectedPrompt)
}

// Protect a response
protectedResponse, responseResult, err := manager.ProtectResponseEnhanced(ctx, llmResponse, userPrompt, userID, sessionID, templateID)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to protect response: %v", err)
}

// Use protected response
fmt.Println("Protected response:", protectedResponse)
```

### Advanced Usage

See the example in `examples/enhanced_prompt_protection/main.go` for a comprehensive demonstration of the protection system's capabilities.

## Protection Levels

The system supports three protection levels:

1. **Low**: Basic protection suitable for non-sensitive applications
2. **Medium**: Balanced protection suitable for most applications
3. **High**: Maximum protection suitable for sensitive applications

## Configuration

The protection system is highly configurable, allowing you to:

- Enable/disable specific components
- Set protection levels
- Configure component-specific settings
- Define custom patterns and rules
- Set up approval workflows
- Configure reporting and monitoring

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate protection level**: Choose the protection level based on your application's security requirements.
2. **Enable all components**: For maximum protection, enable all components.
3. **Monitor and analyze**: Regularly monitor and analyze reports to identify new threats.
4. **Update patterns**: Keep the pattern library up to date with the latest prompt injection techniques.
5. **Test thoroughly**: Test your application with various prompt injection techniques to ensure it's properly protected.

## Security Considerations

While the Prompt Injection Protection System provides comprehensive protection against known prompt injection techniques, it's important to remember that:

1. No security system is 100% effective
2. New prompt injection techniques are constantly emerging
3. Regular updates and monitoring are essential
4. Defense in depth is recommended
