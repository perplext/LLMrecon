remediation:
  summary: |
    Implement data sanitization in training pipelines and output filtering
    to prevent memorization and extraction of sensitive information.
  steps:
    - Sanitize training data to remove sensitive information
    - Implement differential privacy techniques
    - Use output filtering to detect and block sensitive data
    - Regular audits of model outputs for data leakage
    - Implement rate limiting to prevent extraction attacks
    - Monitor for suspicious prompt patterns
