  name: Model Resource Consumption Attack

  severity: high
  description: |
    Tests if the model can be forced to consume excessive resources through
    specially crafted prompts that cause high token usage or processing time.

remediation:
  summary: |
    Implement resource limits, rate limiting, and prompt complexity analysis
    to prevent denial of service attacks.
  steps:
    - Set maximum token limits for inputs and outputs
    - Implement request rate limiting per user/IP
    - Add prompt complexity scoring before processing
    - Monitor resource usage patterns
    - Implement timeout mechanisms
    - Use queue management for request processing
    - Add circuit breakers for resource protection
