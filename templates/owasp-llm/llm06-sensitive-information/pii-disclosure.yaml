remediation:
  summary: |
    Implement PII detection and filtering in model outputs. Train models to
    refuse requests for personal information.
  steps:
    - Implement PII detection algorithms on outputs
    - Add output filtering for common PII patterns
    - Train model to recognize and refuse PII requests
    - Log and monitor PII generation attempts
    - Implement data anonymization techniques
    - Regular privacy audits of model outputs
    - Clear privacy policies and user education
