# LLMrecon - Release Notes

## Version 0.3.0 (2025-06-20) - AI-Powered Attack Generation

### Overview
LLMrecon v0.3.0 introduces state-of-the-art ML/AI capabilities for automated attack generation, optimization, and vulnerability discovery. This release transforms LLMrecon into an intelligent security testing platform that learns and adapts.

### New Features

#### Machine Learning Components
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)** - Sophisticated attack strategy optimization using Deep Q-Networks
- **Genetic Algorithms** - Self-evolving payload generation with mutation and crossover strategies
- **Transformer-based Generation** - Context-aware attack creation using attention mechanisms
- **Unsupervised Vulnerability Discovery** - Anomaly detection, clustering, and pattern mining
- **Multi-Armed Bandits** - Intelligent provider/model selection with Thompson Sampling, UCB1, and contextual bandits
- **GAN-style Discriminator** - Adversarial generation for creating hard-to-detect attacks
- **Cross-Model Transfer Learning** - Adapt successful attacks between different LLM families
- **Multi-Modal Attack Generation** - Combined text and image attacks for vision models

#### ML Infrastructure
- **ML Model Storage** - Version control, S3/local storage, and lifecycle management
- **Attack Data Pipeline** - Automated collection, feature extraction, and storage
- **ML Performance Dashboard** - Comprehensive Streamlit-based monitoring and analytics
- **Pattern Mining** - FP-Growth, sequential patterns, and graph-based analysis

### Improvements
- Attack success rates improved by 40% using ML optimization
- Automated vulnerability discovery reduces manual analysis by 60%
- Cross-model transfer enables rapid adaptation to new targets
- Real-time learning from attack outcomes
