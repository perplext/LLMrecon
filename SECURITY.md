## Security Considerations for LLMrecon Tool

Given the nature of this tool, which is designed to test LLM security, please be aware of the following:

### 1. Responsible Use
- This tool is intended for authorized security testing only
- Users must have explicit permission to test target systems
- The tool should not be used for malicious purposes

### 2. Template Security
- Templates containing attack payloads should be handled with care
- Ensure templates are from trusted sources
- Review template content before execution

### 3. API Key Security
- Never commit API keys or credentials to the repository
- Use environment variables or secure credential storage
- Rotate API keys regularly

### 4. Output Handling
- Be cautious when sharing test results as they may contain sensitive information
- Sanitize outputs before including them in reports
- Store results securely

### 5. Network Security
- Use secure connections (HTTPS/TLS) for all API communications
- Be aware of potential data leakage through network requests
- Consider using VPN when testing sensitive systems
