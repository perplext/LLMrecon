# LLM Red Teaming Tool – Extended Features PRD

## Full Update System for Tool and Components

**Feature Overview:** Extend the tool with a comprehensive update mechanism covering the core binary, vulnerability templates, and provider modules. This system allows self-updating of the CLI tool (if enabled by the user) as well as retrieval of the latest templates and modules. Every component update will include version tracking (using semantic versioning for the binary and version identifiers or commit hashes for templates/modules) and reference the relevant changelog entries.

**User Stories:**
* As a security engineer, I want to update the red teaming tool and its test templates with a single command so that I can quickly obtain the latest vulnerability checks and fixes without manual reinstallations.
* As a tool user, I want the tool to notify me if a new version or template update is available (and optionally auto-update itself) so that I'm always testing against the most current known issues.
* As a compliance officer, I need the tool to maintain version information and changelogs for each update so that we have an audit trail of changes and can demonstrate continuous improvement of our AI risk management in line with ISO/IEC 42001.

## Versioning and Modular Structure for Templates & Modules

**Feature Overview:** Introduce a clear versioning scheme and modular file structure for vulnerability templates and provider modules. Each template will carry a version or revision identifier and unique ID. Provider modules will also have version numbers and compatibility metadata. The system will support syncing these templates/modules from remote repositories, with the flexibility to pull from GitHub (for official production releases) and GitLab (for development or internal releases) as sources.

**User Stories:**
* As a template developer, I want to version-control my red teaming templates so that I can track changes and ensure consistency between different deployments of the tool.
* As a power user or enterprise admin, I want to sync the tool's database of tests with our internal GitLab repository (for custom tests) in addition to the official GitHub repository, so that our private test cases are integrated alongside public ones.
* As a user, I want the tool to show version info for each loaded module and template so that I can quickly identify what test definitions I am using and know if any might be outdated.

## Backend Extensibility via RESTful API

**Feature Overview:** Design and implement a backend API layer that exposes the core functionalities of the LLM Red Teaming Tool through a set of RESTful endpoints. This will allow external systems – including future GUIs, web dashboards, or integration scripts – to interact with the tool programmatically.

**User Stories:**
* As a developer of a web dashboard, I want to connect to the LLM red teaming engine via an API so that I can build a user-friendly interface for users to configure scans and view results in real time.
* As a DevOps engineer, I want to trigger red-team scans automatically via scripts or CI/CD pipelines by calling an API so that AI model deployments can be tested for vulnerabilities as part of our release process.
* As a security analyst, I want to retrieve the results of scans and reports through a programmatic interface, so I can aggregate and analyze them in our central security dashboard alongside other security testing results.

## Offline Updates and Bundle Packaging

**Feature Overview:** Create a mechanism for offline updates of the tool and its components. This will enable users in air-gapped environments or with strict network policies to keep their red teaming capabilities current without requiring direct internet access.

**User Stories:**
* As a security engineer in a regulated environment, I want to update the red teaming tool in an air-gapped system so that we can test our internal LLM applications without requiring internet connectivity.
* As an enterprise administrator, I want to create a vetted bundle of the latest templates that can be transferred to our secure environment after approval, so that we maintain control over what test cases are introduced.
* As a compliance officer, I need to document what updates were applied to our red teaming tools, even in offline environments, so that we can demonstrate due diligence in our AI security testing.

## CLI Extensions for Updates and Bundling

**Feature Overview:** Extend the command-line interface with new commands and options to support the update and bundle features. In addition to the core scanning commands the tool already provides, the CLI will gain subcommands for checking and applying updates, as well as managing offline bundles.

## Alignment with ISO/IEC 42001 and OWASP LLM Top 10

The proposed features have been crafted to ensure the tool supports organizational compliance and security best practices for AI systems:

* ISO/IEC 42001 – AI Management and Continuous Improvement
* OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications
  * Supply Chain Security (OWASP LLM Risk #3)
  * Prompt Injection and Evolving Attacks
  * Transparency and Monitoring
  * Audit Trail
