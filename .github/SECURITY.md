## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability
2. Email security details to the maintainers through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. Include the following information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets or API keys**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Add sensitive files to `.gitignore`

2. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and sanitize user input
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper rate limiting

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Run `go mod tidy` regularly
   - Monitor for known vulnerabilities with tools like Dependabot

4. **Code Review**
   - All PRs must be reviewed before merging
   - Security-sensitive changes require additional review

### For Users

1. **API Keys and Credentials**
   - Store API keys securely using environment variables
   - Never hardcode credentials in configuration files
   - Use separate API keys for testing and production

2. **Testing Environment**
   - Only test against models you own or have permission to test
   - Use isolated environments for security testing
   - Never test against production systems without authorization

3. **Data Handling**
   - Be aware that attack payloads and responses may contain sensitive data
   - Secure any logs or reports generated by the tool
   - Follow your organization's data handling policies

## Security Features

LLMrecon includes several built-in security features:

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: Validates all user inputs
- **Secure Storage**: Credentials stored using system keychain when available
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks all security-relevant operations
- **TLS Support**: Encrypted communication with LLM providers

## Automated Security Scanning

This project uses:
- **CodeQL**: For static analysis and vulnerability detection
- **Dependabot**: For dependency vulnerability alerts
- **Go Security Checker**: For Go-specific security issues

## Response Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Response within 24 hours
- **High severity**: Response within 3 days
- **Medium/Low severity**: Response within 7 days

## Credits

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities.
